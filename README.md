## Overview

**Reboot – Robotics AI Network** is a specialized AI-powered robotics services.  
It enables developers to build, deploy, and validate intelligent robotic systems on a blockchain-backed, incentive-driven network — combining distributed AI computation with secure consensus.

---

## What It Does

Reboot Subnet provides a framework for:

- **Robot Control** – AI-powered decision-making and motion control  
- **Sensor Data Processing** – Distributed analysis of robotics sensor streams  
- **Task Execution** – Coordinated multi-robot task allocation and execution  
- **Learning & Adaptation** – Continuous improvement from shared robotic experiences  
- **Safety & Validation** – Automated safety checks and operational verification  

Miners deliver robotics AI services, while validators ensure accuracy, safety, and performance.
